1. The screen above shows the basics tab. Select your Azure subscription.
2. You can now create a resource group or select one that has already been made.
3. Then, choose a name for your virtual machine and then select the region that you are operating in.
4. For availability zones and security type, you can select the first option.
5. The next option is for the operating system, you can just select Windows 10 or 11.
6. The last step is the size. For now you can choose the 1 vcpu thats the cheapest. For larger projects like running Osticket or an active directory, i would use an option with more virtual processors.
7. Create your username and password
8. Select the networking tab.

 The above image is the network tab. Here you can see the default name for your virtual network, subnet and public IP address. Make note of them and select review+create, which is the final tab.

On this tab, we can see an overview of the virtual machine along with its cost, which is mostly determined by the size that was chosen. The fewer the virtual processors, the cheaper it usually is. From here, we can just click on create at the bottom.

 It will take a little bit for the virtual machine to deploy.
